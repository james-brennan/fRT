    	Function which decides whether a ray

    	this is a model for the total extinction coefficient:
    		eg the probabilty that photon travelling along direction 
    			x interacts with a leaf

    	Need to define a geometry factor G(x)
    	assume that photons hits leaf if direction dot with leaf normal is small
    		-- because horizontal leaf angle is assumed to be isotropic
    			this is sampled each time


    	For now assume this is based on:
    		-- angle between leaf and ray dir less than 30Â°
    		-- modulated by area density
